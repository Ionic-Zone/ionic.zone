# Welcome to ionic.zone

Ionic Zone aims to be the #1 source for educational content about [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/) and related technologies. This means original content about every topic a new or experienced Ionic developer could need, but also curating what great content is out there by other authors.

Currently there is not too much here:

* [Fastlane and Ionic](fastlane)
* [An (slighty outdated) Overview of Ionic's Github Repositories](understand/ionic-github-repositories)
* [Planned content](content)

This will change soon.
