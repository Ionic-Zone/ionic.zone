# Overview of the Capacitor CLI, @capacitor/cli

Most of the interactions you will have with [Capacitor](what-is-capacitor.md), the recently alpha-release Cordova successor by Ionic, will be through its Command Line Interface or CLI: `npx cap`.

This article describes how it works and lists all its commands and explains what they do:

- [npx?](#npx-)
- [1. Create a Capacitor project](#1-create-a-capacitor-project)
  * [a) `npx cap init [appName] [appId]`](#a---npx-cap-init--appname---appid--)
  * [b) `npx @capacitor/cli create [appDir] [appName] [appId]`](#b---npx--capacitor-cli-create--appdir---appname---appid--)

## npx?

The `cap` in `npx cap` obviously stands for "Capacitor", which would have been a bit too long to type regularly. 

But did you notice the `npx` in front of it? `npx` is a [relatively new "package runner"](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/162869356040/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner) from the team behind `npm` that allows you to run npm packages as CLI tools without globally installing them.

If you used Cordova or Ionic before, you know that the first step before being able to create a project with them is always to create a global installation of their CLI tool by running `npm install -g cordova` or `npm i -g ionic`. Then `cordova` or `ionic` becomes available globally in your command line.

`npx` on the other hand enables you to a) run a _local package_ from the project you are working on or b) run a _package that is not (yet) installed in your project_ or even _outside of a project context_ alltogether.

The first two Capacitor commands use these options:

## 1. Create a Capacitor project

To [create your Capacitor project](https://capacitor.ionicframework.com/docs/getting-started/) you have two options:

### a) `npx cap init [appName] [appId]`

> Initializes a new Capacitor project in the current directory

If you already have a web app with a `package.json` file, for example one built with Ionic, you start by installing the CLI and the Core library via `npm` as usual:

```
npm install @capacitor/cli @capacitor/core
```

Then you can use the `init` command from above to create the initial Capacitor configuration file, `capacitor.config.json`, in your existing project.

### b) `npx @capacitor/cli create [appDir] [appName] [appId]`

> Creates a new Capacitor project

If you start without an existing web app project, you can use `npx` to temporarily download and install `@capacitor/cli` and use its `create` command to generate a whole Capacitor project with a rudimentary web app included (that has `@capacitor/core` installed).  

## 2. Add native platforms

To actually start development of a native app you now have to add the platforms you want to support in your app to the project:

### `npx cap add [platform]`

> Add a native platform project

Running `npx cap add ios` and `npx cap add android` will create a `ios` or `android` folder that contain ordinary native platform projects - with some Capacitor goodness added in.

It also runs `sync` - details see below - to setup the native project.

## 3. Develop your app

Yeah, there is not really a CLI command for that - you have to do that manually ðŸ˜„ 

But there are 2 commands that might make it easier for you:

### `npx cap open [platform]`

Opens the project in the native IDE for the chosen platform: Xcode for iOS, Android Studio for Android.

### `npx cap serve`

> Serves a Capacitor Progressive Web App in the browser

If your web app doesn't have its own `serve` or `watch` workflow, Capacitor provides a minimal implementation that runs the current content of `www` in your default browser.

## 4. Update your native Capacitor project(s)

Now that you have your native projects (via `npx cap add`) there are two tasks that you have to run from time to time:

### `npx cap copy [platform]`

> copies the web app build into the native app

Each time you create a new build of your web app in `www`, it has to be copied over to the native platforms to be included in the next native build of the app. `cap copy` takes care of that. 

If you run your build via e.g. `npm run build`, it probably makes to add the `npx cap copy` command to the end automatically. For an Ionic project this might look like this:

```
# package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "ionic-app-scripts build && npx cap copy",
  },
}

```

### `npx cap update [platform]`

> updates the native plugins and dependencies based in package.json

If you also changed something with the native plugins installed via `npm` (Capacitor and Cordova plugins) or updated Capacitor itself, you will have to use `update` to also apply those changes to the native projects. (Capacitor itself calls this ["Periodic Maintenance"](https://capacitor.ionicframework.com/docs/basics/workflow/#4-periodic-maintenance)). The process copies over the plugin files and "installs" them into the native projects so they will automatically be picked up the next time the native app is built.

Beware: For iOS this process might take quite long as it does a lot of things with Cocoapods for the plugins, which is also why this is a separate command from `copy`.

### `npx cap sync [platform]`

> update + copy

This convenience command combines `copy` and `sync` from above. Use it if you want to make sure all changes are synced to the native projects.

## 5. Helpers

There are also 2 more commands that might come in handy during development:

### `npx cap doctor [platform]`

> checks the current setup for common errorsnpx 

### `npx cap plugin:generate`

> start a new Capacitor plugin

And that's it! As Capacitor doesn't abstract building and packaging your apps (read more about the [differences between Cordova and Capacitor](differences-to-cordova.md), these are all the commands that currently exist and are needed.
