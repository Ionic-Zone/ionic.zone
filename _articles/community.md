# Notable members of the Ionic Community

There are many people in the Ionic community that share their experience and knowledge by creating blog posts, tutorials, articles, Youtube videos, or even books or courses that can help other Ionic users.

Here is an initial list of people I came up with on the first try:

- Sani Yusuf - presentations, courses
- Julien Renaux - [talks](https://julienrenaux.fr/talks/), tutorials
- Mike Hartington - courses, Slack, Wwitter
- Ashteya Biharisingh - tutorials
- Paul Halliday - courses, youtube, tutorials
- Simon Grimm - tutorials, [membership site](https://ionicacademy.com/)
- Joshua Morony - videos, tutorials, book
- Raymond Camden - course
- Max Schwarzm√ºller - courses
- Aaron Czichon - tutorials, meetups
- Matthieu Drula - tutorials, book
- Yann Braga - tutorials
- Jave Bratt - articles (Firebase)
- Eddy Verbruggen - Cordova plugins

I will expand on that list and most importantly add more links to what these people actually create and why they are listed here.
